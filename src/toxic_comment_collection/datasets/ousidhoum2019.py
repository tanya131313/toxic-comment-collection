# From the Paper:
# Hence, our annotations indicate
# (a) whether the text is direct or indirect
# (b) if it is offensive, disrespectful, hate-ful, fearful out of ignorance, abusive, or normal
# (c) the  attribute  based  on  which  it  discriminates against an individual or a group of people
# (d) the name  of  this  group
# (e) how  the  annotators feel  about  its  content  within  a  range  of  negative to neutral sentiments.
